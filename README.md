# plant-phenomics-kaust
Field phenotyping data analysis from KAUST internship. Includes trait distribution, species comparison (t-test), and automated plot summarization in R.

# [Plant Phenomics & Field Data Analysis]
**Context:** Research internship at KAUST (Jesse Poland Lab).
 **Focus:** Digital phenotyping and statistical evaluation of plant traits.
 **Key Skill:** Advanced R (Tidyverse), Hypothesis Testing, and Phenotypic Visualization (ggplot2).

# Plant Phenomics & Field Data Analysis (KAUST) 🌾📊

This repository contains R scripts developed during my research internship at **KAUST** (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology) in the **Jesse Poland Lab**.

##  Project Overview
The project focuses on digital phenotyping—analyzing physical traits of plants (Sesame and Wheat) to support breeding programs.

##  Features
* **Field Data Cleaning:** Processing raw datasets from the `Field Book` mobile application.
* **Trait Summarization:** Custom R functions for calculating plot-level statistics (Mean, SD).
* **Statistical Validation:** Hypothesis testing (t-test) to compare growth performance between species.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Correlation analysis between plant height, leaf count, and biomass.

##  Repository Structure
* `phenotyping_analysis.R`: Main analysis script.
* `Plant_Trait_Dataset.csv`: Sample dataset containing phenotypic observations.
* `images/`: Visualization plots (Histograms, Boxplots).

##  Learning Outcomes
Demonstrated proficiency in using **Tidyverse** for agricultural data science and applying statistical methods to real-world field trials.
